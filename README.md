# netflix-clone-react
In this project I built a front-end Netflix Clone with a Firebase back-end. I utilize the TMDB API(A Movie API) for all of the data, I used Firebase Authentication to give login and signup features. This web application use React front-end with Firebase back-end, which allow it to store user-specific data. To save data, I use Firestore, a cloud storage system integrated with Firebase. It's a single-page application that enables users to log in and retain the information for their favourite movies. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS - an incredible CSS framework to save time styling my apps. Then I build and deploy the web app with Firebase hosting.
